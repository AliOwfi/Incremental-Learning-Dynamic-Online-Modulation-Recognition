# [Dynamic online modulation recognition using incremental learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10556007)

This repository contains the code for the paper **"Dynamic online modulation recognition using incremental learning"**, which was presented at 2024 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC). The code provides the implementation of the utilized incremental learning algorithms for the proposed dynamic DL-based modulation recognition framework.

## Dataset
We used the RadioML 2018.01A dataset for all evaluations which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pinxau1000/radioml2018).
